This directory is intended for Platform\+IO Unit Testing and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more M\+CU program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early in the development cycle.
